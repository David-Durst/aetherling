# Aetherling's SpaceTime Intermediate Representation
To build this part of the project:
1. Install the latest version of [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
2. Clone the entire [Aetherling repository](https://github.com/David-Durst/aetherling)
3. Build the project:
```
stack build
```
4. Look at the examples in (src/examples/Main.hs)
5. Either 
    1. Run the produced binary to see all the examples and their space/time requirements. You can do find the binary by looking at the output of the build command
    2. Load the package in the Haskell interpreter and try out your own examples. This can be done by running:
    ```
    stack ghci
    ```
