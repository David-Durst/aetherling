"""
This package provides the space-time types and type-manipulating operators for compiling
from Aetherling's space-time DSL to Magma operators in the aetherling.modules package.

The modules and types in this package do not create any hardware. They are just type manipulations
to simplify calling the real Magma modules in aetherling.modules.
